1,Until the Last Breath,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLZ0AWshFH4," Put it on the table, your things, your work, your things, your problems. Put it on the table so that the sheikh is looking, he can speak about it. You know? That is a normal case. The normal case from the murid, from the disciple, from the follower of the Shaykh, who is asking the Shaykh for advice. The Prophet said, The way is sincere advice. How you are asking sincere advice? You must ask. You must ask. You have to ask. You can do it by heart. If you can do and you receive by heart, it's a certain level, it's possible. Why not? And if you wait, you may also get the answer from your Shaykh later, but it's coming through your sheikh anyway. But it is sunnah, especially worldly things, to put them on the table, to be clear. And it is allowed and it is sunnah. So you should ask him, you know. Unser Bruder hat gefragt, dass er gehört hat von wahrscheinlich hochspirituellen No, no, he heard that you don't ask the Sheikh anything. Because you are highly spiritual and when you come to the Sheikh, he already knows everything. That's true, he knows everything. But you don't know everything. That's why you ask the Sheikh. You ask him. First of all, it's Sunnah. It's the Sunnah of the Prophet . Look at the companions of the Prophet and how they asked the Prophet, what they asked the Prophet. The books are full of it, there are millions of questions and answers. There are hadiths, what they asked him. All kinds of things. From Dunya and Akhira. They asked him everything. And that's the Sunnah. The Sunnah didn't stop. You ask your Sheikh. If you are unsure about something, then ask him. You can ask him everything. Everything. Everything. What you have to ask him, for example, you have to ask him. It is a duty, it is a journey for a murid, it is at the wedding, at the divorce and at long journeys, long, extraordinary long journeys, not to your home country or something, that is clear, that is your home country. But to undertake a long journey. There you ask the sheikh, so that the sheikh looks. Because the sheikh looks then. He looks at the couple, which he would like to marry. He looks and gives permission or not. And when they are divorced, he gives permission or not. When they travel far away, he gives permission or not. That's why it's a question of Sunnah. The Prophet also said, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, adinu nasiha, that the way, the religion, the way is sincere advice. Advice. How do you want advice? If you ask for advice, then you ask for advice. Then you ask someone for advice. And someone who is honest. And your Sheikh is honest. So you have to ask him. With us, sometimes we are honest, sometimes we are not. It depends on the situation of the nation. Inshallah. the situation of the nation. Inshallah. But you can ask your brother or you can ask the Sheikh. If you can't figure out the answer, you can always ask the Sheikh. You can ask the Sheikh for everything. We could ask everything about Sheikh Nazim. We can ask everything about Sheikh Mohammed now. Everything. Inshallah. Today is the Ulus of Mawlana Sheikh Nazim. Karas al-Silva is here. Today is the Ulus of Mawlana Sheikh Nazim. And Mawlana Sheikh Mohammed, he was giving suhba today in honor of his father. And he was saying that Mawlana Sheikh Nazim, he was serving the ummah all his life. All his life. All his life he was serving the Ummah. Even when he was born and baby and child, through his blessed being, from divinely blessings, he was serving the Ummah automatically. Then when he was conscious he was serving the Ummah and his he was the follower, khalifa of Mawlana Sheikh Abdullah Faiz al-Daghestani Qadassas al-Rawaliya, who was khalifa, the next one in the golden chain of Naqshbandiya, Aliyah. And when Grand Sheikh Abdullah Faiz Daghestani was going to pass away, he knew his, the awliyas, they knew when they are going sometimes. And he knew that he is going and he said to Maulana and he put Maulana as Khalifa, Maulana Shaykh Nazim. Then Maulana Shaykh Nazim, he was asking his Shaykh, that's also a question he asked his Shaykh, what shall I do? Oh my Shaykh, I am intending, if you give permission, I am intending to go after you passing away. I go to Medina Munawwara, to the tomb of Prophet ﷺ at his door and they want to sit there until I die. That is my intention, nothing else. And Grandsheikh Qarasaarvaria was answering him. He was saying, O Nazim Effendi, that is not for you to go there. For you is to go to England, to the West, to the crazy ones, to save people from shaitan as much as you can, to save them. from Shaytan as much as you can to save them. You go to England and you start to save people, inshaAllah. That is your mission. So in 73, Mawlana Shaykh Abdullah Faiz Daghestani, he was going in Akhira, Karasaasaloha Riyah, and may Allah bless his stations endlessly. And Murana 74 was the first year that he went to England, 74. He start to go. There were little houses, little houses. He served in little houses. Some houses opened, some murids, he found murids quickly because his shining appearance incited love in the hearts of people immediately and there were some small houses in Greenlands and before Greenlands, I don't know, but Greenlands I saw, the monarher was serving the people. He was cooking for them. They didn't know how to cook. He cooked and he was giving sukhba and making zikr and collecting hearts. He's a collector of hearts. And he was a collector of hearts. And he was a collector of hearts until his end. Until his end. He wanted to, when he was sick in the last years, before 2014, maybe 2013, and 2011, he had some sicknesses. In the end he was saying, I want to, if I get another sickness, I want to stay home. He said, not in the hospital. But as it came, the destiny, it happened that they put him in the hospital because they were hoping that he recovers. They were hoping that he recovers. There was a little chance of recovering, so they were hoping, so they put him in the hospital. Torturing, they tortured him. It was a hospital in Levkosher. It was three weeks, I think he was there. And there was only one patient there, maybe one other patient, and the only patient was Sheikh Nazim. It was a private hospital and the hospital was full of Naqshbandis. The whole hall and all the rooms, other rooms were full of Naqshbandis. Three weeks camp in the hospital and Mawlana from his bed, thick person, everything, pipes and terrible things, he was still managing everything from there, from his room, managing the people and the whole hospital. There were so many things happening, people meeting and speaking, enemies became friends and so many things happening every day from morning to night and night to morning. Too many things happening every day from morning to night and night to morning. He was serving until his last breath. Until his last breath. That was Eid of Rajab. And Eid of Rajab. I don't know. it was also Friday. I don't know. Then he went, serving the Ummah. Mawlana Sheikh Nasim is his Olus today and Mawlana Sheikh Mohammed made Zubayr today in honor of his father and said that he, Mawlana Sheikh Nasim, was there for his whole life for the Umm there and served the Umma his whole life, 92 years. It means from the first year on, from the first moment on, his existence on this earth was blessed. Through this blessing was the service to humanity, service served the Ummah. The Ummah is the whole humanity. Since the prophet, peace be upon him, whether she is white or not, he has served the humanity through his presence. And when he came to his consciousness, he deliberately served. He learned deliberately, deliberately served. Throughout his life. Throughout his life he traveled. His whole life. He traveled his whole life. And when he became a Caliph by Grand Sheikh Abdullah that he is going, because the saints know when they are going, they get the message before they go, and said that he is going to Mawlana Sheikh Nazim, made him the Khalifa, his successor, Sheikh Abdullah Faiz al-Astani, he said, O my Sheikh, with your permission, if you go, then I have the intention to go to Medina Munawwara, the grave of the Prophet and wait there for my end of life. Nothing else I want to do, go there, to the door of the Prophet until I die. That is my wish and my intention. With your permission. And I said to him, no permission for that, O Nasim Effendi, your task is to go to the West, to England. To England and there to gather people and to save people, to save people from Shaitan, from Nafs, from the Dunya, to save, to bring them on the way and to bring healing and to bring them to paradise. It is your task. It is 1973, 1973 the Grand Sheikh died and in 1974 Mawlana Sheikh Nasim went to England. First year. He started in small houses that were provided to him. Small houses where there were 5 or 6 people. With his appearance he immediately lit the hearts, lit them with love. And he camped with them in these houses, cooked for them. They didn't know how to cook. They didn't know what to do. Then they threw away the meat and he got took it out of the trash can. The meat was already a bit crumbling. He put it in a pot and cooked it for four hours. And then he served it. And made it nice and tasty. And then he had some green lanes, I saw them. I was there in Ramadan 1980, I was on a bus from Cyprus to London. For a few days, for a week I think we were on the road. And then we arrived there and there Maulana Sheikh in green lanes. And he did Zubat. There were a few people, maybe 10 people, 15 people. And so he served Maulana Sheikh Nasim until the end. At the end of his life, when he got sick and the diseases came in the last years. Then one year before, in 2013, he said, if I get sick again, I don't want to go to the hospital anymore. I want to stay at home and die there. But the fate was that he did come to the hospital, because everyone just hoped that there were a few percent chances that he would recover from this disease and that we would have him a little longer. That then overcame and then he was in the hospital and was tortured there with gush and everything around him. In a room. He was the only patient in the whole hospital. A private hospital. The whole rest of the hospital was full of nackt-spandits. The whole hall downstairs was full. All the rooms were full. There was prayer, there was talking, there were a thousand things that Maulana conducted from his sickbed, so to speak. And he has the hearts in his hand and conducts them, mashallah. And so he served until his last breath. Until his last breath. Mehmet Nazim reported that Sheikh Mehmet Nazim, his grandson, that he was still with him a few hours before or an hour before and Mornana was already somehow gone, but when he was standing there, he was suddenly there and took his arm and held it and said, sword, give strength, give your energy, give everything. Just like you gave everything. He said, in front of 30,000 people, 30,000 Turks, he said, I am saying Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar. But that was somewhere else I think it was in England it was an official speech there were many people he said I say Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar and I want to say every square centimeter Allahu Akbar on this whole earth that's my intention everywhere every square centimeter überall, jeden Quadratzentimeter sagen Allahu Akbar auf dieser ganzen Erde. Ist meine Intention. Überall. Jeden Quadratzentimeter. Allahu Akbar. He said, Mawlana Sheikh, I want to say Allahu Akbar in all the world, every square centimeter. If I can, everywhere I will say. On earth and also in heaven. Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar wa Akbar. And he was saying when Mawlana Shaykh, when he was in the hospital, the last hour maybe, Mehmet Nazim, he was saying, Sheikh Mehmet Nazim, his grandson that he went into his room, was one of the last ones who saw him. And he was there and he was lying there. But when he came, he was awake, opened his eyes, he take his arm very firmly and then implicating keep it with strength, with power. Maybe one hour. Last breath. This is Awliya. This is Mawlana Shaykh Nasim. This is Sunnat al-Rasool Habibullah until his last breath. Fatimah al-Zahra until her last breath. Sayyidina Ali until his last breath. Sayyidina Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, last breath. Khulafa al-Ashidin, until last breath. Awliya al-Kiram, until last breath. Everyone, until last breath. Breathing means serving, to serve. This is our intention. You must have this intention. And at least you have to say astaghfirullah as long as you live. For your wrong doings, wrong thinking, for pride, envy, hidden bad manners, you must ask forgiveness before you die. After dying, you repent when you are in hell. Mawlana Shaykh Muhammad was saying, no use, finished. You must know, you must say astaghfirullah. Not in akhira, it's too late. As long as you have one breath, and that breath, your last breath, you must say astaghfirullah, Ya Rabb, have mercy on me, on my soul. I was wrong. You are great, endless greatness and I am wrongdoer. Forgive me. endless greatness and I am wrongdoer. Forgive me. At least we should everyone as Sheikh Mohammed emphasized today ask for forgiveness as long as he lives and breathes. As long as he has a breath he should take the opportunity to ask for forgiveness for his bad deeds, bad thoughts, bad adab, hidden bad qualities. The last breath is a chance to say, astaghfirullah, you are aahab, ya Allah, and I am a sinner, forgive me. Until the last breath. After that, who does not do that, he lands in a bad area, a very bad area, and there is a sinlessness, it is not accepted anymore. It is not accepted anymore. It is not accepted anymore. Everyone should think about it. And Allah takes it, Inshallah. Allah takes your remorse. If it is sincere, He takes it, Inshallah. May Allah protect us, Inshallah. And let us be with Mawlana Sheikh Nasim and Sheikh Muhammad and let us be with Al-ana Sheikh Nazim and Sheikh Muhammad, all the Rabbani, inshaAllah. Wa min Allah at-tawfiq bi hurmatil Fatiha."," Put it on the table, your things, your work, your things, your problems. Put it on the table so that the sheikh is looking, he can speak about it.

And when he became a khalifa by Grand Sheikh Abdullah Faiz Daghestani, he said that he was going, because the saints know when they are going, they get the message before they go, and said that he is going to Mawlana Sheikh Nazim, made him the Khalifa, his successor, Sheikh Abdullah Faiz al-Astani, he said, O my Sheikh, with your permission, if you go, then I have the intention to go to Medina Munawwara, the grave of the Prophet and wait there at his door for my end of life. Nothing else I want to do, go there at the door of the Prophet until I die. That is my wish and my intention. With your permission. And I said to him, no permission for that, O Nazim Effendi. Your task is to go to the west, to England. To England and there to gather people and to save people, to save people from Shaytan, from Nafs, from the Dunya, to save, to bring them on the way and to bring healing and to bring them to paradise. It is your task. It is 1973, 1973 the Grand Sheikh died and in 1974 Mawlana Sheikh Nasim went to England. First year. He started in small houses that were provided to him. Small houses where there were 5 or 6 people. With his appearance he immediately lit the hearts, lit them with love. And he camped with them in these houses, cooked for them. They didn't know how to cook. They didn't know what to do. Then they threw away the meat and he got took it out of the trash can. He was already chewing the meat. He put it in a pot and cooked it for four hours. And then he served it. And he made it well and cooked it well. And then he had some... I saw Green, I was there once in Ramadan 1980, I was on the bus from Cyprus to London, for a few days, for a week a week we were on the road. And then we arrived and there was Maulana Sheikh in green lanes and did Zubat. There were a few people, maybe 10 people, 15 people. And so he served Maulana Sheikh Nasim until the end. At the end of his life, when he got sick and the diseases came in the last years. Then one year before, in 2013, he said, if I get sick again, I don't want to go to the hospital anymore. I want to stay at home and die there. But the fate was that he did come to the hospital, because everyone just hoped there were a few percent chance that he would recover from this disease and that we would have him a little longer. That then overcame and then he was in the hospital and was tortured there with gush and everything around it. In a room. He was the only patient in the whole hospital. A private hospital. The whole rest of the hospital was full of nacktis. The whole hall downstairs was full. All rooms were full. There was prayer, there was talking, there were a thousand things that Maulana from his sickbed has conducted, so to speak. And he has the hearts in his hand to this day and conducts them. Mashallah. And so he served until his last breath. Until his last breath. Mehmet Nazim reported that Sheikh Mehmet Nazim, his grandson, was still with him a few hours before or an hour before. And Mornana was already somehow gone, somehow. But when he was standing there, he was suddenly there and took his arm and held it and said ... Sword! Give strength! Give your energy! Give everything! He said, in front of 30,000 people, 30,000 Turks, he said, I am saying Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar. But that was somewhere else, I think it was in England. There was an official speech, there were many people. He said, I say Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar. And I want to say Allahu Akbar everywhere, every square centimeter on this whole earth. That's my intention. Everywhere. Everywhere, every square centimeter, say Allahu Akbar, on this whole earth. This is my intention. Everywhere, every square centimeter, Allahu Akbar. He said, Mawlana Sheikh, I want to say Allahu Akbar in all the world, every square centimeter. If I can, everywhere I will say. On earth and also in heaven. Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar wa Akbar. And he was saying when Mawlana Shaykh, when he was in the hospital, the last hour maybe, Mehmet Nazim, he was saying, Sheikh Mehmet Nazim, his grandson, that he went into his room, was one of the last ones who saw him, and he was there and he was lying there, but when he came he was awake, opened his eyes, he take his arm very firmly and then implicating keep it with strength, with power. Maybe one hour. Last breath. This is Awliya, this is Mawlana Shaykh Nasim, this is Sunnat al-Rasool Habibullah until his last breath, Fatimah al-Zahra until her last breath, Sayyidina Ali until his last breath, Sayyidina Abu Bakr al-Siddiq until his last breath, Khulafa al-Rashidin until until last breath. Awliya al-Kiram, until last breath. Everyone, until last breath. Breathing means serving, to serve. This is our intention. You must have this intention. And at least you have to say astaghfirullah as long as you live. For your wrong doings, wrong thinking, for pride, envy, hidden bad manners, you must ask forgiveness before you die. After dying you repent when you are in hell. Mawlana Shaykh Muhammad was saying, no use, finished. You must know, you must say astaghfirullah. Not in akhira, it's too late. As long as you have one breath, and that breath, your last breath, you must say astaghfirullah, Ya Rabb, have mercy on me, on my soul. I was wrong. innaka la min amul, supana rabbika, supana ka inni kuntu min azorimeen. You are great, endless greatness and I am wrongdoer. Forgive me. At least we should, everyone, as Sheikh Mohammed emphasized today, ask forgiveness, as long as he lives and breathes, as long as he has one breath left, he should take the opportunity to ask forgiveness for his bad deedsullah, you are aahab, ya Allah, and I am a sinner, forgive me. Until the last breath. After that, who doesn't do that, ends up in a bad area. A very bad area, and there is a senseless remorse. It is not accepted anymore. It is not accepted anymore. Everyone should think about it. And Allah takes it, Inshallah. Allah takes your remorse. If it is sincere, He takes it, Inshallah. May Allah protect us. Inshallah. And let us be with Mawlana Sheikh Nasim and Sheikh Mohammed Al-Rabbani. Wa min Allah at-tawfiq bi hurmatil Fatiha."," Put it on the table, your things, your work, your things, your problems. Put it on the table so that the sheikh is looking, he can speak about it. You know? That is a normal case. The normal case from the murid, from the disciple, from the follower of the Shaykh, who is asking the Shaykh for advice. The Prophet said, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, الدين النسيحة The way is sincere advice. How you are asking sincere advice? You must ask. You must ask. You have to ask. You can do it by heart. If you can do and you receive by heart, it's a certain level, it's possible. Why not? And if you wait, you may also get the answer from your Shaykh later, but it's coming through your sheikh anyway. But it is sunnah, especially worldly things, to put them on the table, to be clear. And it is allowed and it is sunnah. So you should ask him. Our brother asked that he heard from a highly spiritual murid. He heard that you don't ask the Sheikh anything. Because you are highly spiritual and when you come to the Sheikh, he already knows everything. That's right, he knows everything. But you don't know everything. That's why you ask the Sheikh. You ask him. First of all, it is Sunnah. It is the Sunnah of the Prophet . Look at the companions of the Prophet and how they asked the Prophet, what they asked the Prophet. The books are full of it. There are millions of questions and answers. There are hadiths. What they asked him. All kinds of things. From Dunya and Akhira. They asked him everything. And that's the Sunnah. The Sunnah didn't stop. You ask your Sheikh. If you are unsure about something, then ask him. You can ask him everything. Everything. Everything. What you have to ask him, for example, you have to ask him. It is a duty, a duty for a murid, is at marriage, at divorce and at long journeys, extraordinary long journeys, not to your home country or something, that's clear, that's your home country, but to undertake continue your journey. You ask the sheikh, so that the sheikh looks. Because the sheikh looks then. He looks at the couple he wants to marry. He looks and gives permission or not. And when they are divorced, he gives permission or not. When they travel far away, he gives permission or not. That's why it's a question of Sunnah. The Prophet also said, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, adinu nasiha, that the path, the religion, the path is sincere advice. Advice. How do you want advice? If you ask for advice, then you ask for advice. Then you ask someone for advice. And someone who is honest. And your Sheikh is honest. So you have to ask him. With us, sometimes we are honest, sometimes we are not. It depends on the situation of the nation. Inshallah. the situation of the nation. Inshallah. But you can ask your brother or you can ask the sheikh. If you can't figure out the answer, you can always ask the sheikh. You can ask the sheikh for everything. We could ask everything about Sheikh Nazim. We can ask everything about Sheikh Mohammed now. Everything. Inshallah. Today is the Ulus of Mawlana Sheikh Nazim. Karas al-Silva is here. Today is the Ulus of Mawlana Sheikh Nazim. And Mawlana Sheikh Mohammed, he was giving suhba today in honor of his father. And he was saying that Mawlana Sheikh Nazim, he was serving the ummah all his life, all his life, all his life he was serving the Ummah. Even when he was born and baby and child through his blessed being from divinely blessings, he was serving the Ummah automatically. Then when he was conscious he was serving the Ummah and his he was the follower, khalifa of Mawlana Sheikh Abdullah Faiz al-Daghestani Qadassas al-Rawaliya, who was khalifa, the next one in the golden chain of Naqshbandiya, Aliyah. And when Grand Sheikh Abdullah Faiz Daghestani was going to pass away, he knew his, the awliyas, they knew when they are going sometimes. And he knew that he is going and he said to Maulana and he put Maulana as Khalifa, Maulana Shaykh Nazim. Then Maulana Shaykh Nazim, he was asking his Shaykh, that's also a question he asked his Shaykh, what shall I do? Oh my Shaykh, I am intending, if you give permission, I am intending to go after you passing away. I go to Medina Munawwara to the tomb of Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam at his door and they want to sit there until I die. That is my intention, nothing else. And Grandsheikh Qarasa Sarwarieh was answering him. He was saying, Oh, Nazim Effendi, that is not for you to go there. For you is to go to England, to the West, to the crazy ones, to save people from shaitan as much as you can to save them. You go to England and you start to save people, inshaAllah. That is your mission. So in 73, Mawlana Shaykh Abdullah Faiz Daghestani, he was going in Akhira, Karasaasaloha Aliyah, and may Allah bless his stations endlessly. And Murana 74 was the first year that he went to England, 74. He start to go. There were little houses, little houses. He served in little houses. Some houses opened, some murids, he found murids quickly because his shining appearance incited love in the hearts of people immediately and there were some small houses in Greenlands and before Greenlands, I don't know, but Greenlands I saw, the monarher was serving the people. He was cooking for them. They didn't know how to cook. He cooked and he was giving sukhba and making zikr and collecting hearts. He's a collector of hearts. And he was a collector of hearts. And he was a collector of hearts until his end. He wanted to, when he was sick in the last years, before 2014, maybe 2013, 11 or he had some sicknesses. In the end he was saying, I want to, if I get another sickness, I want to be, I want to stay home. He said, not in the hospital. But as it came, the destiny, it happened that they put him in the hospital because they were hoping that he recovers. They were hoping that he recovers. There was a little chance of recovering, so they were hoping, so they put him in the hospital. Torturing, they tortured him. It was a hospital in Levkosher. It was three weeks, I think he was there. And there was only one patient there, maybe one other patient, and the only patient was Sheikh Nazim. It was a private hospital and the hospital was full of Naqshbandis. The whole hall and all the rooms, other rooms were full of Naqshbandis. Three weeks camp in the hospital and Mawlana from his bed, thick person, everything, pipes and terrible things, he was still managing everything from there, from his room, managing the people in the whole hospital. There were so many things happening, people meeting and speaking, enemies became friends, and so many things happening every day, from morning to night and night to morning. He was serving until his last breath. Until his last breath. That was Eid of Rajab. And Eid of Rajab. I don't know. it was also Friday. I don't know. Then he went, serving the Ummah. Mawlana Sheikh Nasim is his Olus today and Mawlana Sheikh Mohammed made Zubayr today in honor of his father and said that he, Mawlana Sheikh Nasim, was there for his whole life for the Ummah and served the Umma his whole life, 92 years. It means from the first year on, from the first moment on, his existence on this earth was blessed. Through this blessing was the service to humanity, service to the Umma. Umma is the whole humanity. He served the Ummah. The Ummah is the whole humanity. Since the prophet, peace be upon him, whether she is white or not, he has served the humanity through his presence. And when he came to his consciousness, he deliberately served. He learned deliberately, deliberately served. Throughout his life. Throughout his life he traveled. His whole life. He traveled his whole life. And when he became a Caliph by Grand Sheikh Abdullah that he was going, because the saints know when they are going, they get the message before they leave, and he said that he was going to Mawlana Sheikh Nazim, he made him the Khalifa, his successor, Sheikh Abdullah Faiz al-Astani, he said, O my Sheikh, with your permission, if you go, then I have the intention to go to Medina Munawwara, the grave of the Prophet and wait there for my end of life. Nothing else I want to do, go there, to the door of the Prophet until I die. That is my wish and my intention. With your permission. And I said to him, no permission for that, O Naseem Effendi. Your task is to go to the West, to England. To England and there to gather people and to save people, to save people from Shaytan, from Nafs, from the Dunya, to save, to bring them on the way and to bring healing and to bring them to paradise. It is your task. It is 1973, 1973 the Grand Sheikh died and in 1974 Mawlana Sheikh Nasim went to England. First year. He started in small houses that were provided to him. Small houses where there were 5 or 6 people. With his appearance he immediately lit the hearts, lit them with love. And he camped with them in these houses, cooked for them.

And then we arrived and there was Maulana Sheikh in green lanes. And he did Zubat. There were a few people, maybe 10 people, 15 people. And so he served Maulana Sheikh Nasim until the end. At the end of his life, when he got sick and the diseases came in the last years. Then one year before, in 2013, he said, if I get sick again, I don't want to go to the hospital anymore.

The whole rest of the hospital was full of nacktis. The whole hall downstairs was full. All the rooms were full. There was prayer, there was talking, there were a thousand things that Maulana from his sickbed has conducted, so to speak. And the hearts he has until today in the hand and conducts them, Mashallah. And so he served until his last breath. Until his last breath. Mehmet Nazim reported that Sheikh Mehmet Nazim, his grandson, that he was still with him a few hours before or an hour before and Mornana was already somehow gone, but when he was standing there, he was suddenly there and took his arm and held it and said ... Sword! Give strength! Give your energy! Give everything! He said, in front of 30,000 people, 30,000 Turks, he said, I am saying Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar. But that was somewhere else, I think it was in England. There was an official speech, there were many people. He said, I say Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar! And I want to say Allahu Akbar everywhere, every square centimeter on this whole earth. That's my intention. Everywhere, every square centimeter, Allahu Akbar. He said, Mawlana Sheikh, I want to say Allahu Akbar in all the world, every square centimeter. If I can, everywhere I will say. On earth and also in heaven. Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar wa Akbar. And he was saying when Mawlana Shaykh, when he was in the hospital, the last hour maybe, Mehmet Nazim, he was saying, Sheikh Mehmet Nazim, his grandson, that he went into his room, was one of the last ones who saw him. And he was there and he was lying there. But when he came, he was awake, opened his eyes, he took his arm very firmly and then implicating keep it with strength, with power. Maybe one hour. Last breath. This is Awliya, this is Mawlana Shaykh Nasim, this is Sunnat al-Rasool Habibullah until his last breath, Fatimah al-Zahra until her last breath, Sayyidina Ali until his last breath, Sayyidina Abu Bakr as-Siddiq until his last breath, Khulafa al-Ashidin, until last breath. Awliya al-Kiram, until last breath. Everyone, until last breath. Breathing means serving, to serve. This is our intention. You must have this intention. And at least you have to say astaghfirullah as long as you live. For your wrong doings, wrong thinking, for pride, envy, hidden bad manners, you must ask forgiveness before you die. After dying, you repent when you are in hell. Mawlana Shaykh Muhammad was saying, no use, finished. You must know, you must say astaghfirullah. Not in akhira, it's too late.
